# LegalEase AI - Comprehensive Project Summary

## Project Overview
LegalEase AI is a cutting-edge legal technology application designed to revolutionize commercial real estate (CRE) lease management through advanced AI-powered document analysis. The platform enables legal professionals, property managers, and real estate stakeholders to upload lease documents and receive intelligent, automated summaries and abstracts of key provisions, dramatically reducing manual review time and human error.

## Core Problem & Solution
**Problem**: Manual CRE lease review is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive, with legal professionals spending countless hours extracting key terms from dense legal documents.

**Solution**: AI-powered platform that automatically parses lease documents, extracts critical data points, and generates professional summaries and structured abstracts in downloadable formats.

## Target Users & Market
- **Primary**: Commercial Real Estate Lawyers (expediting due diligence and client abstracts)
- **Secondary**: Property Managers (operational clause access and compliance monitoring)
- **Additional**: Real Estate Investors, Leasing Agents, Corporate Legal Departments

## Business Goals & Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: 70% reduction in average lease abstraction time
- **Accuracy**: 95% accuracy in key data extraction for common lease clauses
- **Growth**: 50 paying enterprise clients within 18 months
- **Performance**: <5 minutes processing time for 100-page documents

## Technical Architecture

**Platform**: Cloud-native web application on AWS with hybrid architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React/TypeScript) deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI for API services + AWS Lambda for AI processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) for structured data
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for secure document storage
- **AI Services**: Amazon Textract (OCR) + Amazon Comprehend (NLP)
- **Infrastructure**: Monorepo (Nx), AWS CDK, GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Architecture Pattern**: Jamstack frontend + Hybrid backend (API service + serverless functions) with asynchronous processing via AWS SQS queues.

## Core Features (MVP)
1. **Secure Document Upload**: PDF/DOCX lease upload with validation
2. **AI-Powered Processing**: Automated OCR, text extraction, and NLP analysis
3. **Key Data Extraction**: Parties, lease terms, rent schedules, renewal options, etc.
4. **Summary Generation**: Concise AI-generated lease overviews
5. **Structured Abstracts**: Categorized extraction of important lease items
6. **Multi-Format Downloads**: PDF, DOCX, and Markdown export options
7. **User Management**: Secure authentication and document dashboard
8. **Processing Status**: Real-time status tracking and error handling

## Sample Files for Development

The `/samples` directory contains essential reference materials for development:

- **Sample Lease Documents** (`/samples/lease-documents/`): Real commercial lease agreements demonstrating input complexity
- **Sample Lease Abstracts** (`/samples/lease-abstracts/`): Professional abstracts showing expected output quality and structure
- **Development Guidelines**: Use these files to understand lease structure, validate AI accuracy, and ensure professional output standards

## PRD Sharding Results
The 292-line PRD has been successfully decomposed into 8 logical components:

1. **prd-overview.md** - Goals, background, target users, success metrics
2. **prd-requirements.md** - 8 functional + 4 non-functional requirements, MVP scope
3. **prd-ux-design.md** - UX vision, interaction paradigms, accessibility (WCAG AA)
4. **prd-technical-assumptions.md** - Architecture decisions, tech stack, constraints
5. **prd-epic1-foundation.md** - Infrastructure and core document handling (4 stories)
6. **prd-epic2-ai-processing.md** - AI pipeline and abstract generation (5 stories)
7. **prd-epic3-output.md** - Output generation and user feedback (2 stories)
8. **prd-validation.md** - Quality assurance checklist (98% completeness, ready for architecture)

## Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: 98% PRD completeness score
- **Testing Strategy**: Full testing pyramid (unit, integration, E2E)
- **Security**: Encryption at rest/transit, WCAG AA compliance
- **Accuracy Requirement**: 95% minimum for key data extraction
- **Performance Target**: Sub-5-minute processing for 100-page documents
