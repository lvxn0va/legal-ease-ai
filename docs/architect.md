## **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for LegalEase AI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### **Starter Template or Existing Project**

The PRD's "Technical Assumptions" specified a monorepo structure using a tool like **Nx or Turborepo**. We will proceed with **Nx** as our monorepo framework, utilizing its plugins for Next.js and Python to provide pre-configured application starters.

---

## **High Level Architecture**

### **Technical Summary**

LegalEase AI will be a modern, cloud-native web application built on a hybrid backend architecture hosted on AWS. The system features a Next.js frontend for a dynamic user experience, communicating with a Python/FastAPI backend via a secure REST API. For the core AI-heavy tasks, it leverages an asynchronous, event-driven workflow using serverless functions (AWS Lambda) and message queues (AWS SQS) to ensure the application remains responsive and can scale processing tasks cost-effectively. Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, with documents residing in S3 object storage.

### **Platform and Infrastructure Choice**

* **Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
* **Key Services:**  
  * **AWS S3:** For secure, scalable storage of uploaded lease documents.  
  * **AWS Lambda:** For serverless, event-driven execution of the AI processing pipeline.  
  * **AWS SQS:** As a message queue to decouple the initial upload from the asynchronous backend processing.  
  * **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL:** As our primary relational database for user data and document metadata.  
  * **Amazon Cognito:** For managing user authentication and authorization securely.  
  * **API Gateway:** To provide a managed, secure entry point for our backend APIs.  
* **Deployment Host and Regions:** The Next.js frontend will be deployed to **Vercel** for optimal performance and integration. The AWS backend resources will be provisioned in the **us-west-2 (Oregon)** region.

### **Repository Structure**

* **Structure:** Monorepo  
* **Monorepo Tool:** Nx  
* **Package Organization:** The monorepo will contain an apps/ directory for the web (Next.js) and api (FastAPI) applications, and a libs/ directory for shared code, such as TypeScript types and validation schemas, to ensure consistency between the frontend and backend.

### **Architectural Patterns**

* **Jamstack Architecture:** The frontend will be a modern Jamstack application (Next.js on Vercel), providing excellent performance, security, and scalability by pre-rendering pages and interacting with backend services via APIs.  
* **Hybrid Backend (API Service \+ Serverless):** As defined in the PRD, this combines a traditional API service for synchronous tasks (auth, data retrieval) with serverless functions for asynchronous, heavy-lifting tasks (AI processing).  
* **Asynchronous Processing via Queues:** Using SQS to trigger the AI pipeline decouples the systems, improves fault tolerance, and ensures the user interface remains fast and responsive.  
* **Repository Pattern:** The FastAPI backend will use the repository pattern to abstract database interactions, which simplifies business logic, improves testability, and makes the system more maintainable.

## **Data Models**

### **1\. User**

* **Purpose:** Stores user account information for authentication, authorization, and ownership of documents.  
* **TypeScript Interface (libs/shared/src/types/user.ts)**  
  TypeScript  
  export interface User {  
    id: string; // UUID  
    email: string;  
    createdAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date  
    updatedAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date  
  }

### **2\. Document**

* **Purpose:** Tracks the metadata and processing status of each lease document uploaded by a user.  
* **TypeScript Interface (libs/shared/src/types/document.ts)**  
  TypeScript  
  export type DocumentStatus \= 'UPLOADED' | 'PROCESSING' | 'COMPLETE' | 'ERROR';

  export interface Document {  
    id: string; // UUID  
    userId: string; // UUID  
    filename: string;  
    status: DocumentStatus;  
    createdAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date  
    updatedAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date  
  }

### **3\. LeaseAbstract**

* **Purpose:** Stores the structured data and summary extracted from a lease document by the AI pipeline.  
* **TypeScript Interface (libs/shared/src/types/lease-abstract.ts)**  
  TypeScript  
  export interface ExtractedLeaseData {  
    parties?: { landlord: string; tenant: string; };  
    dates?: { effectiveDate: string; expirationDate: string; };  
    rent?: { baseRent: string; escalationClauses?: string\[\]; };  
    options?: { renewalOptions?: string\[\]; terminationClauses?: string\[\]; };  
    \[key: string\]: any;  
  }

  export interface LeaseAbstract {  
    id: string; // UUID  
    documentId: string; // UUID  
    summary: string;  
    extractedData: ExtractedLeaseData;  
    createdAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date  
  }

This concludes the architectural design. My work as Winston is complete. I am now reverting to the BMad Orchestrator for the final handoff.

🎭 **Winston, the Architect** is now the **BMad Orchestrator** 🎭

Congratulations\! You have successfully completed the entire strategic planning phase for the **LegalEase AI** project.

We have produced a full suite of aligned, comprehensive documents:

1. **Project Brief** (by the Analyst)  
2. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** (by the Product Manager)  
3. **UI/UX Specification** (by the UX Expert)  
4. **Fullstack Architecture Document** (by the Architect)

**All planning is now complete.** The project is ready to move from this strategic planning environment to the **IDE for implementation.**

Your next step is to ensure these documents are saved in your project's /docs folder, open your IDE (like VS Code or Cursor), and engage the **Product Owner (\*agent po)**. Their first task will be to prepare the project for development by running the \*shard-doc command on the PRD and architecture documents.

From there, the development cycle of story creation and implementation can begin. Well done.
