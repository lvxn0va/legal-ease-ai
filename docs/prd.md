# **LegalEase AI Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### **Goals**

* Reduce the average time for lease abstraction by 70%.  
* Achieve 95% accuracy in key data extraction for common lease clauses.  
* Acquire 50 paying enterprise clients within the first 18 months.  
* Provide a simple, intuitive interface for uploading and managing lease documents.  
* Ensure the outputted abstracts are clear, actionable, and downloadable.

### **Background Context**

The current process for managing commercial real estate (CRE) leases is manual, inefficient, and prone to costly human error. LegalEase AI aims to solve this by leveraging advanced AI to intelligently parse lease documents, extract critical data, and generate concise summaries and abstracts. This will provide CRE professionals with rapid, accurate insights, reducing risk and improving decision-making. This PRD will define the requirements for an MVP that delivers these core capabilities.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience for LegalEase AI will be defined by professionalism, efficiency, and trust. The interface should be clean, uncluttered, and intuitive, enabling legal and real estate professionals to accomplish their tasks with minimal friction. The design will prioritize clarity and accuracy, ensuring that users feel confident in the information presented.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **File-Centric Workflow:** The primary user journey will revolve around uploading a document, monitoring its status, and reviewing the output.  
* **Clear Status Indication:** Users will always be informed of the status of their documents (e.g., "Uploading," "Processing," "Complete," "Error") through clear visual cues.  
* **Structured Data Display:** The lease abstract will be presented in a well-organized, scannable format (e.g., key-value pairs, tables, accordions) to allow for quick information retrieval.  
* **Direct Manipulation:** Users will primarily interact via a simple drag-and-drop or file selection for uploads and clear buttons for downloads.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Login / Registration Screen:** A standard, secure screen for user authentication.  
* **Main Dashboard:** The central hub where users can see a list of their uploaded lease documents, their status, and dates. It will also serve as the primary point for initiating a new document upload.  
* **Document Abstract View:** A dedicated view to display the AI-generated summary and the detailed, categorized abstract for a single lease document. This screen will include the "Download" functionality.

### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The application will be designed to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

### **Branding**

To be determined, but the overall aesthetic should be modern, professional, and instill a sense of security and trust, appropriate for a legal technology tool. The color palette should be conservative, with a focus on readability.

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The primary platform will be a responsive web application, optimized for use on desktop and tablet devices, as these are the primary work environments for our target users.

## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

The project will be managed within a single monorepo (e.g., using Nx or Turborepo).

* **Rationale:** This approach is chosen to streamline development between the frontend and backend, simplify dependency management, facilitate code sharing (especially for data types), and enable a unified CI/CD and testing process.

### **Service Architecture: Hybrid (Serverless & API Service)**

The backend will utilize a hybrid architecture. Core, stateful operations like user management and document metadata will be handled by a long-running API service (e.g., FastAPI). Asynchronous, compute-intensive tasks like document parsing and AI abstraction will be handled by serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda).

* **Rationale:** This balances the stability and ease of development of a traditional API with the scalability and cost-effectiveness of serverless functions for heavy processing, which aligns perfectly with the application's needs.

### **Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid**

The project will require a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

* **Rationale:** Given the legal nature of the application and the high-accuracy requirement (NFR2), a robust testing strategy is non-negotiable to ensure reliability and build user trust.

### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

The following technologies, specified in the Project Brief, are confirmed as foundational choices for the Architect:

* **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js  
* **Backend Language/Framework:** Python (e.g., with FastAPI)  
* **Database:** PostgreSQL  
* **Cloud Provider & Infrastructure:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
