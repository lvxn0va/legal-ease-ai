LegalEase AI aims to solve this by leveraging advanced AI to intelligently parse lease documents, extract critical data, and generate concise summaries and abstracts. This will provide CRE professionals with rapid, accurate insights, reducing risk and improving decision-making. This PRD will define the requirements for an MVP that delivers these core capabilities.
