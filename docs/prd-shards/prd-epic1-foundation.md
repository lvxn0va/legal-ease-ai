# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Document Handling

**Expanded Goal:** This foundational epic will establish the entire project's technical backbone, including the monorepo setup, a basic CI/CD pipeline, and core user authentication. It will deliver the first tangible user-facing features: a secure system for users to create an account, upload their lease documents, and see them listed on a central dashboard. Upon completion, we will have a secure, functional application ready for the core AI features of Epic 2.

## Story 1.1: Initialize Project Monorepo and CI/CD Pipeline

**As a Developer, I want a configured monorepo with a basic CI/CD pipeline, so that I can efficiently build, test, and deploy the application from a unified codebase.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. A monorepo is initialized using a standard tool (e.g., Nx or Turborepo).  
2. Skeletons for the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Python/FastAPI) applications are created within the monorepo.  
3. A basic health-check endpoint is functional and reachable for both the frontend and backend services.  
4. A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is configured to run linters and basic tests on every commit to the main branch.  
5. A basic Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline is configured to deploy the applications to a development environment on AWS.

## Story 1.2: Implement User Registration and Login

**As a new User, I want to register for an account and log in securely, so that I can access the application and manage my documents.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. A user can create a new account using their email and a password.  
2. User passwords are to be securely hashed and stored in the database, never in plain text.  
3. A registered user can log in using their email and password.  
4. The system issues a secure session token (e.g., JWT) upon a successful login.  
5. Basic client-side and server-side validation is present on both registration and login forms (e.g., for email format, password complexity).  
6. Users are redirected to their document dashboard after a successful login.

## Story 1.3: Implement Secure Document Upload

**As a logged-in User, I want to upload a lease document (PDF or DOCX), so that the system can store and prepare it for processing.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. An authenticated user is presented with an option to upload a file (e.g., a file input or drag-and-drop area).  
2. The application validates that the selected file is of type PDF or DOCX before starting the upload.  
3. The uploaded file is securely transferred and stored in a designated cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3).  
4. A corresponding record for the document (including filename, upload date, user ID, and an initial status of "Uploaded") is created in the database.  
5. The user receives clear visual feedback indicating the upload's progress and its successful completion or failure.

## Story 1.4: Create Document Management Dashboard

**As a logged-in User, I want to see a list of all the documents I have uploaded, so that I can track their status and access them easily.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The dashboard is the default view for an authenticated user.  
2. The dashboard displays a list or table of the user's previously uploaded documents, sorted by upload date (newest first).  
3. Each item in the list clearly displays the document's filename, the date of upload, and its current processing status (e.g., "Processing", "Complete", "Error").  
4. If a user has not uploaded any documents, the dashboard displays a clear message and a prominent call-to-action to upload their first document.

## Epic 1 Deliverables

Upon completion of Epic 1, the system will have:
- Complete project infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline
- Secure user authentication system
- Document upload functionality with cloud storage
- User dashboard for document management
- Foundation ready for AI processing capabilities in Epic 2

## Technical Dependencies

- Nx/Turborepo monorepo setup
- Next.js frontend application skeleton
- FastAPI backend application skeleton
- AWS infrastructure (S3, RDS, Cognito)
- PostgreSQL database schema for users and documents
- Basic security and validation frameworks
