# LegalEase AI - UX Design Requirements

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience for LegalEase AI will be defined by professionalism, efficiency, and trust. The interface should be clean, uncluttered, and intuitive, enabling legal and real estate professionals to accomplish their tasks with minimal friction. The design will prioritize clarity and accuracy, ensuring that users feel confident in the information presented.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **File-Centric Workflow:** The primary user journey will revolve around uploading a document, monitoring its status, and reviewing the output.  
* **Clear Status Indication:** Users will always be informed of the status of their documents (e.g., "Uploading," "Processing," "Complete," "Error") through clear visual cues.  
* **Structured Data Display:** The lease abstract will be presented in a well-organized, scannable format (e.g., key-value pairs, tables, accordions) to allow for quick information retrieval.  
* **Direct Manipulation:** Users will primarily interact via a simple drag-and-drop or file selection for uploads and clear buttons for downloads.

## Core Screens and Views

* **Login / Registration Screen:** A standard, secure screen for user authentication.  
* **Main Dashboard:** The central hub where users can see a list of their uploaded lease documents, their status, and dates. It will also serve as the primary point for initiating a new document upload.  
* **Document Abstract View:** A dedicated view to display the AI-generated summary and the detailed, categorized abstract for a single lease document. This screen will include the "Download" functionality.

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG AA Compliance
The application will be designed to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding Guidelines

To be determined, but the overall aesthetic should be modern, professional, and instill a sense of security and trust, appropriate for a legal technology tool. The color palette should be conservative, with a focus on readability.

## Target Platforms

### Web Responsive
The primary platform will be a responsive web application, optimized for use on desktop and tablet devices, as these are the primary work environments for our target users.

### Browser Support
* Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
* Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
* Desktop and tablet form factors (mobile optimization not required for MVP)
