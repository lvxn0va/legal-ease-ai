- **prd-requirements.md**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **prd-technical-assumptions.md**: Technical architecture assumptions and constraints

### 2. Design Components  
- **prd-ux-design.md**: User interface design goals, interaction paradigms, and accessibility requirements

### 3. Epic Components (Development Phases)
- **prd-epic1-foundation.md**: Foundation & Core Document Handling (Stories 1.1-1.4)
- **prd-epic2-ai-processing.md**: AI Processing & Abstract Generation (Stories 2.1-2.5)
- **prd-epic3-output.md**: Output & Finalization (Stories 3.1-3.2)

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **prd-validation.md**: Checklist results and readiness assessment
