# LegalEase AI - Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure

### Monorepo Architecture
The project will be managed within a single monorepo (e.g., using Nx or Turborepo).

**Rationale:** This approach is chosen to streamline development between the frontend and backend, simplify dependency management, facilitate code sharing (especially for data types), and enable a unified CI/CD and testing process.

## Service Architecture

### Hybrid (Serverless & API Service)
The backend will utilize a hybrid architecture. Core, stateful operations like user management and document metadata will be handled by a long-running API service (e.g., FastAPI). Asynchronous, compute-intensive tasks like document parsing and AI abstraction will be handled by serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda).

**Rationale:** This balances the stability and ease of development of a traditional API with the scalability and cost-effectiveness of serverless functions for heavy processing, which aligns perfectly with the application's needs.

## Testing Requirements

### Full Testing Pyramid
The project will require a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

**Rationale:** Given the legal nature of the application and the high-accuracy requirement (NFR2), a robust testing strategy is non-negotiable to ensure reliability and build user trust.

## Technology Stack

### Confirmed Technologies
The following technologies, specified in the Project Brief, are confirmed as foundational choices for the Architect:

* **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js  
* **Backend Language/Framework:** Python (e.g., with FastAPI)  
* **Database:** PostgreSQL  
* **Cloud Provider & Infrastructure:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Platform Requirements

### Target Platforms
* **Web browser** (responsive design for desktop and tablet)
* **Browser/OS Support:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on Windows, macOS, and Linux
* **Performance Requirements:** Lease upload to abstract generation within 5 minutes for average-sized leases (50-100 pages)

## Infrastructure Assumptions

### AWS Services
* **AWS S3:** For secure document storage
* **AWS Lambda:** For serverless AI processing functions
* **AWS SQS:** For asynchronous message queuing
* **Amazon RDS:** For PostgreSQL database hosting
* **Amazon Cognito:** For user authentication and authorization
* **API Gateway:** For managed API endpoints
* **Amazon Textract/Comprehend:** For OCR and NLP processing

### Deployment Strategy
* **Frontend:** Vercel (for optimal Next.js performance and integration)
* **Backend:** AWS (us-west-2 Oregon region)
* **Infrastructure as Code:** AWS CDK with TypeScript

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
* Data encryption at rest and in transit
* Robust user authentication and authorization
* Compliance with legal data handling best practices
* Secure document upload and storage workflows

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
* Reliance on third-party AI services for core NLP/OCR, limiting deep customization of underlying models for MVP
* Leases must be machine-readable (no handwritten documents for MVP)
* API usage costs for AI services must remain within acceptable operational budget

### Key Assumptions
* High-quality, machine-readable PDF/DOCX lease documents are consistently available from users
* AI services can achieve sufficient accuracy for legal document understanding
* Users are willing to upload sensitive legal documents to a cloud-based platform given proper security assurances
* The legal interpretation of key lease terms is generally consistent enough to be abstracted algorithmically
