# LegalEase AI - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR1:** The system must allow users to upload commercial lease documents in both PDF and DOCX formats.  
2. **FR2:** The system shall use AI to automatically parse the content of uploaded leases.  
3. **FR3:** The system shall extract key, predefined data points from the lease, including but not limited to: Parties, Lease Term, Rent Schedule, and Renewal Options.  
4. **FR4:** The system shall generate a concise, human-readable summary of the lease's key provisions.  
5. **FR5:** The system shall generate a structured, categorized abstract of important lease items.  
6. **FR6:** Users must be able to download the generated summary and abstract in PDF, DOCX, or Markdown formats.  
7. **FR7:** The system must provide secure user registration and login functionality.  
8. **FR8:** Authenticated users must be able to view a dashboard listing their uploaded documents and the current processing status of each.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1:** The end-to-end document processing time, from upload to abstract availability, shall be under 5 minutes for leases of up to 100 pages.  
2. **NFR2:** The AI data extraction must achieve a minimum accuracy of 95% for the predefined key data points on standard CRE lease formats.  
3. **NFR3:** The application must be a responsive web application, fully functional on the latest stable versions of major desktop and tablet browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
4. **NFR4:** All user documents and extracted data must be encrypted both at rest (in storage) and in transit (over the network).

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
* **Document Upload:** Users can upload PDF and DOCX commercial lease files.  
* **AI-Powered Parsing & Understanding:** Automated extraction of core lease data points (e.g., lease parties, effective date, lease term, rent schedule, renewal options, termination clauses, use clauses, assignment/subletting).  
* **Lease Summary Generation:** AI-generated concise summary of the entire lease, highlighting its purpose and key agreements.  
* **Lease Abstract Generation:** AI-generated structured abstract of important lease items, organized by customizable categories.  
* **Downloadable Output:** Users can download the summary and abstract in a user-friendly format (e.g., PDF, DOCX, Markdown).  
* **Basic User Authentication:** Secure login and user management.  
* **Document Management:** Ability to view a list of uploaded documents and their processing status.

### Out of Scope for MVP
* Complex clause negotiation/redlining suggestions.  
* Compliance monitoring beyond basic term alerts.  
* Integration with external CRM or property management systems.  
* Multi-language support (English only for MVP).  
* Advanced analytics dashboards or portfolio-level reporting.  
* AI-powered contract drafting.  
* Handling of non-CRE lease types (e.g., residential, equipment leases).  
* Complex conditional logic parsing (e.g., deeply nested "if-then-else" clauses that require multi-document context).

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if it reliably and accurately processes standard commercial lease documents, providing users with actionable summaries and abstracts that save them significant time in their review process, leading to positive initial user feedback and adoption by early adopters.
