# Epic 3: Output & Finalization

**Expanded Goal:** This final epic for the MVP completes the core user journey by providing the tangible output that professionals need. It focuses on taking the AI-generated abstract and summary from Epic 2 and making it available to the user in common, portable document formats. Completing this epic ensures that the value created by the AI is not trapped within the application but can be easily shared, archived, and integrated into our users' existing workflows.

## Story 3.1: Generate and Download Lease Abstract

**As a logged-in User, I want to download the generated lease abstract and summary in a standard document format, so that I can save it locally, share it with clients, or import it into other systems.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. On the "Document Abstract View" page, a clear and accessible "Download" button is present.  
2. Clicking the button presents the user with options to download the abstract in PDF and Markdown formats.  
3. Selecting a format triggers the on-demand generation of a file containing both the summary and the structured abstract.  
4. The generated file is well-formatted, professional in appearance, and clearly organized for readability.  
5. The file download is successfully initiated in the user's browser.

## Story 3.2: Implement a Basic Feedback Mechanism

**As a logged-in User, I want to provide simple feedback on the accuracy of an abstract, so that I can help improve the system's performance over time.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. On the "Document Abstract View" page, a simple, non-intrusive feedback mechanism is available (e.g., a "Report an error" button or a thumbs up/down rating).  
2. Interacting with the feedback mechanism logs the relevant document ID, the user's feedback, and a timestamp to the database for future analysis.  
3. The user receives a simple confirmation message (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback!") after submission.  
4. The mechanism is designed to be low-friction and does not require the user to fill out a detailed form for the MVP.
